# YERP (Your Emergency Response Platform)

YERP! (Your Emergency Response Platform) is a privacy-focused, affordable platform for smart spotting of enclosed spaces for signs of potential opioid overdose and other medical emergencies.

It's also fully modular system, built on top of <a href="https://home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a>, made to accommodate a wide variety of needs across different types of spaces, different accessibility needs, and different preferences for drug users, service providers and loved ones.

The files in this repo are the contents of the config folder from the Home Assistant installation YERP! is being built on. The focus so far has been building out a usable and reliable setup, before bundling everything down (read: before learning how to bundle everything down!) into integrations, widgets and blueprints.
